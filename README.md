# ICS2Notion
Uses the ICS token URL from D2L (Brightspace) to track assignments on Notion.

How to use:
* Edit configs.ini with your tokens. Everything but the Discord bot tokens is required.
* Run main.py

Optional Automation:
Set up a cron job on a server to run the program, say, once or twice a day, to stay up to date with your assignments.
